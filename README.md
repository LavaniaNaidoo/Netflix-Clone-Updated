# Updated Netflix Clone

Hi there and Welcome to my Netflix Clone Project!
    This Project is if Netflix were made by me ;-)

Files/Folders Needed To See This Project (in order):
    -Landing Page (landingPage.html to see basic and similar Netflix Registration page)
    -Login Page (Main.html to see User Login page)
    -Manage Profiles Page (manageProfiles.html to see User Accounts and Profiles)
    -Homepage(Index.html to see homepage of Netflix App)

To begin navigating this project:
1-) Start with the "landingPage.html" (located in the Landing Page Folder as well) to which you can see the basic structure and design as the     original Netflix Landing Page.
    -In the top right hand corner, you should see a simple "Sign-In" button to which it will redirect you to the next awesome page in my project!

2-) The next page to which you should be redirected to, is the Login Page (located in the Login Page folder with the file name "Main.html").
    -Here you will see the basic and very similar layout and design as the original Netflix Sign-In page. 
    -It has Form Validation and it will show up with an alert to input the correct details (which there are none, it was just a cool feature to   have on the login page).
    -After this, you can click on the the red "Sign-In" button, to which you will be redirected to the "Manage Profiles" page!

3-) After the Login Page, you should be redirected to the "Manage the profiles!" page (located in the Manage Profiles Page folder with the page    name "manageProfiles.html")
    -This is a really cool page to which you can view all the different profiles you can have in a Netflix Account.
    -It has a few profiles in general, which is the exact replica to my family's own Netflix Profiles page and I tried my best to get it to look the same and have the same feel as well. 
    -After perusing the profiles page, you can then click on the "Go to homepage!" button underneath the profiles to which you will be redirected to the main homepage of my Netflix Clone!

4-) After perusing the profiles page, you can then head on to the main attraction which is the Homepage! (located in the Home Page Folder with the page name as "index.htm") 
    -When you open the page, you will see the header to which you can navigate through the whole page with by clicking on each of the names displayed in the header section (eg. click on "movies" in header and it will direct you to the movies section in the page). 
    -Right underneath the header section, you will find the new and upcoming movie banner "Purple Hearts" and if you click on the "play" button, it will actually play the teaser trailer for the movie, and if you click on the "play" button again it will pause the trailer if you want to. 
    -Underneath the movie banner, you will see the movie sections such as: Home, Movies, TV Shows, Popular, My List, Coming Soon, Bollywood and Watch it again! and in those sections, if you click on the "play" buttons of any of them, they will redirect you to YouTube to where the movie trailers will begin to show and play.It also shows you the Name and Movie Description Of desired movie. You can also click on the arrow in the right hand corner to show more movies as well!
    -Unfortunately, the "My List" button is yet to work due to the fact that I was unable to come up with a suitable function that works adequately to display the desired movies in a personalized watchlist.

Other Cool Features:
    -On the "homepage" (main netflix home) if you wanna sign out, just click on the "Me" at the top right hand corner of the page and it will take you back to the Login Page. 
    -The homepage also has a search bar at the top right hand corner, next to the "Me" button, it was displayed and designed purely for the aesthetic.

And thats a wrap on my whole Netflix Clone Project! 
    Quick Disclaimer, I tried my best to get my clone aethestically close to the actual Netflix Website along with the functionality of it as well and any comments or suggestions will be highly appreciated! Happy perusing!
